  "brief": "HannoverMarathi is a modern, professional static website representing the Marathi-speaking community in Hannover, Germany. It is designed to promote cultural events, connect members, and provide registration and contact information. The site is built using HTML, CSS (with Flexbox or Grid for layout), and light JavaScript for interactivity. The design follows a clean, mobile-first approach with a professional color palette inspired by Maharashtra's culture â€” warm orange, white, and subtle gray tones. The homepage includes a welcoming banner and navigation to four key sections: About, Programs, Registration, and Contact. Each section has a dedicated page with responsive design, accessible text, and minimalistic layout. The footer includes community links and copyright information. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages.",
